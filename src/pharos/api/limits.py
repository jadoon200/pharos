"""Public-deployment guards for the stateless inference route (POST /score-track).

In-memory, single-process: a per-client sliding-window rate limit and a bounded concurrency cap so
a traffic spike degrades to 429/503 instead of running the box out of memory. The reverse proxy is
the primary defence; these are belt-and-suspenders. See docs/DEPLOY.md.
